### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently studying economics and public policy analysis at University of Bordeaux.  
  
:scroll: I did several internships : one as a laboratory assistant at a health economics institute (ISPED), another as a statistician for the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research.  
  
🌱 I’m currently learning Python and have a keen interest in game theory.  
💬 Ask me about anything
